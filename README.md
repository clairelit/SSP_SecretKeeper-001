"# This app will allow the user to add secrets to it"

"This has been a tough project for me, but one I'm happy I worked on.  I have learned so much while doing it."

"I have looked at so much tutorials, too many to mention, but one which I found really useful was:"
"http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/".  It starts are the very basics and works up from there."
"Another very useful resource was mongoDB's official website.  There, I found a very helpful user interface to view the databases I had created."
"For me it ran on localhost:8081, as instructed by the website."

"Having three command prompts open at the same was a bit weird at first, but I got used to it pretty quickly.  One was the connection to my local DB, another was to use for running the express server and the third one was to connect to the localhost for the visual interface."
